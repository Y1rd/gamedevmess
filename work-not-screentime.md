Nothing as of Sept. 27th, 2023. Will start today or tomorrow.

Oct. 3rd, 2023. I want to add a little cool text description thing that will appear when I hover over the buttons on my index. As to let people know what the pages are about before they click on it.
Edit #2, some success. Got the description working, just can't quite figure out the fade in/out I want. I want the space the text will take up to smoothly show.

Oct. 16th, 2023. I found a github repo called devin's badges. It looks really damn good, I might work this into some project. On the other hand, the trivia that I started coding is finished. I'm quite happy with it, even if it started with a video, it went into making new and different code to achieve what I wanted. I think there is still some bugs with the decoding however that I must fix.

Oct. 26th, 2023. Pretty good progress in javascript, not needing AI as much. Currently need to finish up my list and then I need to do an assignment about events. Gotta yell at the teacher who is marking me to omit one assignment and remark. However, I want to revamp how the descriptions work on my page to be under the button rather then a big box. It doesn't look good on smaller screens.

Nov. 8th, 2023. I've successful made the descriptions better. All my marks are great and I've gotten every assignment in. I've started work on a new project around Minecraft, a datapack to change the world generation.

Nov. 9th, 2023. Found this AI called [Phind](phind.com). It's very intesting and completely free to use. It claims results above GPT-4 for coding. I can verify that.
