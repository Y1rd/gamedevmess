## Personal Research

Nothing as of Sept. 27th, 2023. Will start today or tomorrow.

Oct. 3rd, 2023. I want to add a little cool text description thing that will appear when I hover over the buttons on my index. As to let people know what the pages are about before they click on it.
Edit #2, some success. Got the description working, just can't quite figure out the fade in/out I want. I want the space the text will take up to smoothly show.

Oct. 16th, 2023. I found a github repo called devin's badges. It looks really damn good, I might work this into some project. On the other hand, the trivia that I started coding is finished. I'm quite happy with it, even if it started with a video, it went into making new and different code to achieve what I wanted. I think there is still some bugs with the decoding however that I must fix.
